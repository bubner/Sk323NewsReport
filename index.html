                Ever since the dawn of humanity, we have been surrounded by resources and materials to build the next generation of technology. As a result, we’ve rampantly accelerated our growth over the past century into a world no person could imagine succumbing to. Thousands of hours of research and development into making our planet more advanced than ever, the constant race against the clock to build the next big thing.

                Initially conceptualised in the mid-1930s, the Turing machine was the most significant theory we’ve made that shaped our current technological advancement. Utilising the binary base-2 system and a theoretical infinitely long tape, the Turing machine is able to perform any algorithm or computational calculation given enough time. In today’s world, the hardware we use for computation is classed as Turing complete, referring to the fact that any given hardware is able to complete any algorithm or calculation given enough time and memory, simulating what a Turing machine is capable of.

            <p class="text">
                But why is this important to know?  This is because, with the knowledge we know of Turing machines, computers are technically capable of making decisions for themselves, considering any given Turing complete machine can perform any algorithm or calculation.

                As computers became more widespread, cheaper, and accessible spanning throughout the 1900s, the first steps into what we know today as artificial intelligence was sparked. Through this knowledge, computer scientists and mathematicians have developed hundreds of algorithms that resemble computational intelligence, computers being able to decide intelligent decisions using computing concepts such as nodes and evaluation. A prime example of this emerging technology was in 1997 when the first computer was able to beat Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a game of chess.

            <p class="text">
                Later development into machine learning and reinforcement later proved computers’ abilities to learn, resembling neural networks similar to one of a human brain. This technology has only continued to grow since then, with, in recent years, companies producing publicly accessible large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT models and Google’s LaMDA models.
